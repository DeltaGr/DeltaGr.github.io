			Junior Full Stack Web Developer | ðŸ”¬ Artistic Mind, Architect of Patterns & Code<br> <br>

Graduated and full of ideas â€“ now Iâ€™m here to experiment and push the boundaries of what code can do and to tackle the web
development universe! Iâ€™m a full stack developer with a background in art and design, constantly exploring new ways to blend
creativity with cutting-edge technology and to craft smooth, organized structures.

      <strong>Front-End:</strong> I build clean, structured layouts that are a joy to navigate.
      Playing with Flexbox, grid and building pixel-perfect layouts that follow patterns such as
      responsiveness and modular design.

      <strong>Back-End:</strong> Structuring APIs and databases to make sure data flows like clockwork,
       where every part has its place in the system. Keeping everything in check, organized, and on track,
       like branches in a tree.
       <strong>Tools:</strong> Ruby on Rails, Node.js, MongoDB
